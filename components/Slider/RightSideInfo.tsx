        Want to be on the earning side of those sweet derivative fees? Deposit USDa or TUSDT and ride the wave with potential gains of up to 200% APY. Keep in mind, it's high risk, high reward territory so risks of losing your capital are directly correlated with amount of fall in crypto collateral price.

Head over to the "Redeem" page after one month.
